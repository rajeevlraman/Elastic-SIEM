## Overview
Welcome to my home lab setup! "Dashershomelab" I've created this environment to learn and understand various aspects of networking, monitoring, prevention, administration, and hardening techniques. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to share my setup with you.
This Lab is a simple Elastic SIEM lab to monitor security events and provide alerts. 

### Goal
- Setup and configure elastic stack SIEM.
- Configure Elastic agents for log collections.
- Configure Elastic agents for forwarding data to the SIEM
- Monitoring security events and threat detection.
- Create alert rules for detecting specific events.
